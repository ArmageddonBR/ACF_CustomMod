Create 2 folders anywhere, but DON'T put them in a garrysmod folder I suggest placing it on desktop.
Example:
	Custom ACF Folder
	ACF Folder
----You can use any name, I'm just using these names for the Guide...-----


Install the normal ACF Addon from this SVN below in the "ACF" folder.
https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/trunk


Install the Custom ACF Mod from this SVN below in the "Custom ACF" folder.
https://github.com/bouletmarc/ACF_CustomMod/trunk


Now Copy and paste all the stuff from the "Custom ACF" folder to "ACF" folder
Make sure to Override the files.

Then put "ACF" folder in garrysmod addons directory (garrysmod/garrysmod/addons)
DON'T PUT "Custom" FOLDER IN ADDONS, you will be already running acf with the other above



You can finally remove the "Custom" folder created above, BUT this folder are useful for doing updates and will save time.
So just put this folder on your desktop if you want.


-- While Doing Updates --

If you deleted the Custom ACF folder, re-install the Custom ACF.
If you kept the Custom ACF folder, just right click on the folder and do SVN update.
You can also just copy and paste the Custom mod files directly into "garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/acf" if you already got normal ACF installed.

Just always make sure you are overriding ACF files.
