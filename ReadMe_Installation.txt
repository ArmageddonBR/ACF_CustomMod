Create 2 folder anywhere, better be on Desktop
call the 1st "ACF"
call the 2nd "Custom"
----You can put any name, its just to use this name for the Guide-----


Install the Complet ACF Addons from this SVN bellow in the "ACF" folder
https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/trunk


Install the Custom ACF Mod from this SVN bellow in the "Custom" folder
https://github.com/bouletmarc/ACF_CustomMod/trunk


Now Copy and paste all the stuff from the "Custom" folder to "ACF" folder
Make sure to Override the files

then put "ACF" folder in garrysmod addons directory (garrysmod/garrysmod/addons)
DO NOT PUT "Custom" FOLDER IN ADDONS, you will be already running acf with the other above



You can finnaly remove the "Custom" folder created above, BUT this folder are useful for doing updates
So just put this folder somewhere if you want to keep it safely.


-- While Doing Updates --

just repeat the same process
you can also only copy and paste the custom mod files directly in "garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/acf"

Just always make sure you are overriding acf file's
